CONFIGURATION
-------------

The module does not have a configuration page. You can find all extra field
plugins at Reports > Extra Field Plugins List.


USES
----

To provide the extra field plugin with display settings you must at least
implement the ExtraFieldPlusDisplayInterface.

But there are two base plugins which can help you with this. Just extend
ExtraFieldPlusDisplayBase or ExtraFieldPlusDisplayFormattedBase plugins.

All yours extra field plugins have to be placed in
your_custom_module/src/Plugin/ExtraField/Display folder.

Example plugins with simple and formatted output are in extra_field_plus_example
module.
